For this project, I have created a mobile application for a client and provide unit tests to verify that it meets the customerâ€™s requirements.
The code is broken into 3 different sections (contacts, tasks, and appointment) which all use different serive requirement.
Contacts is focused on adding and updating new contact information
Task is made to add and update new tasks 
Appointments is used to make and update new appointments 
Each segment has pairing test .javas with the purpose of running JUnit test to ensure that each fuction runs properrly
These include test to ensure that the input is not to long, not null and not already existing.
